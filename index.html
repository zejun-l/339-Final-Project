        <p>Flywheel is the University of Michigan's women's ultimate frisbee team. Based out of Ann Arbor, MI, we travel across the country to compete against other high-level programs. Flywheel is made up of many different players, from freshmen who picked up their first disc at fall tryouts to grad students who have been playing for years. We take pride in being a nationally competitive team that continues to grow and work hard each year. For six of the past ten years, we have qualified for Nationals, placing 2nd in 2011, 3rd in 2012, 5th in 2014, 9th in 2016, 2017, and 2018, 19th in 2021, and most recently, 9th in 2024.<br><br>B-Fly is the University of Michigan’s regionally competitive B team. B-Fly also travels across the country to compete against other high-level and developmental programs.</p>
